## Thoughts on typescript
* Been using it for over a year
    * Started to use it after using JavaScript for a while
* Can't code frontend without typescript
    * As well coding big things like that suck without types
## Thoughts on go
* Feels like typescript but better
* I'm really enjoying how smooth it feels so far
* I have made my [gowiki](https://github.com/yonikosiner/wiki-in-go) in go, and
  it feels so much better then if I made it in typescript
* I'm in the middle of re-coding a big project I have into go
